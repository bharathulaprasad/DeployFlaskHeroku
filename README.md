Basic Steps:

 1. Create a pickle from your Machine learning model.                                                                                        
2.Add This pickle model and website template to Flask framework.                                                                              
3.Upload all necessary files such as requirements,Procfile , Flask Application etc in github.                                                   
4.Connect your git repo with heroku and deploy.
